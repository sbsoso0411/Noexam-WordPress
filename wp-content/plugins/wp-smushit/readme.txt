Reduce image file sizes, improve performance and boost your SEO using the free <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/">WPMU DEV</a> WordPress Smush API.

== Description ==

<strong>Resize and optimize all of your images</strong> with the <strong>incredibly powerful</strong> and <strong>100% free image smusher</strong>, brought to you by the superteam at WPMU DEV!

<strong>Now with image resizing!</strong> Set a max width and height and large images will scale down as they are being compressed.

Our servers do all the heavy lifting. Strip hidden bulky information from your images and reduce file size without losing quality.

Large image files may be slowing down your site without you even knowing it. WP Smush uses WPMU DEV’s super servers to quickly smush every single one of your images and cuts all the unnecessary data without slowing down your site.

WP Smush meticulously scans every image you upload – or have already added to your site – cuts all the unnecessary data and scales it for you before adding it to your media library.
