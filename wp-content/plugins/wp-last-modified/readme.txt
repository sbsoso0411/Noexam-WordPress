Show Last Modified date in your WordPress Posts and Pages.

== Description ==

The Last Modified date is used to tell the readers and search engine bots (Google, Yahoo!, Bing etc.) when webpage is updated lastly. People will know the freshness of that web document, and Web crawlers can also decide, whether there's any need to save a new copy of that webpage to update their indexes, or not.

You will also be able to add Revised Meta data to your posts and pages through this plugin, but that is completely optional.

Meta Revised Data syntax:

`&lt;meta name="revised" content="Sunday, April 21, 2013, 2:59 am" /&gt;`

* Allows you to customize the text which is to be displayed alongside the last modified date (i.e. "Last updated on:" in place of "Last modified:")
