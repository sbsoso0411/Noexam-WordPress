<h2>No Exam Works with Only the Best Life Insurance Companies</h2>
<p>As an independent insurance brokerage, our firm is able to choose what carriers we work with in an effort to provide our customers with the quality coverage they deserve. We leverage our industry knowledge paired with life insurance companies that best meet our four quality standards. </p>
<h3>Highly Rated</h3>
<p>While we work with multiple life insurance companies, we tend to focus on providers who have demonstrated excellence in their ability to fulfill financial obligations while proving a strong financial outlook. We have achieved this by working with companies that have proven track records of both long-term stability and success.</p>
<h3>Fast Underwriting</h3>
<p>We value our customers’ time. Delivering prompt service and follow up is important to us. By working with life insurance companies that have the ability to underwrite life insurance applications based on prescription history, motor vehicle reports, and records from the medical information bureau, our staff demonstrates a sense of urgency when it comes to getting our clients’ policies approved and delivered.</p>
<h3>Policy Approvals</h3>
<p>Working with life insurance companies that have moderate underwriting guidelines, coupled with their ability to take on calculated risk based on the strength of their financial portfolio, we have chosen to work with companies that offer the highest rate of life insurance policy approvals. Thus, our commitment to prompt policy approvals for each one of our valued customers is at the forefront of our mission.</p>
<h3>Limits of Coverage ($50,000-$400,000)</h3>
<p>Each insurance company we work with has different terms and conditions in regard to how much life insurance coverage they will provide to our customers without requiring them to take a medical exam. That being said, the providers you see on our website have demonstrated an ability, however, to offer the highest limits of coverage for the longest duration of time without a medical exam being required. </p>
<h2>What No Exam Life Insurance is Good For:</h2>
<h3>Family Income Protection</h3>
<p>Most Americans choose life insurance as a way to provide for their family in the event of an unexpected loss. Ensuring that a family will have the financial stability to cover arrangements following the loss, as well as the means to continue making  mortgage payments and other day to day expenses gives many Americans peace of mind. Furthermore, for many parents, it is very important to them that their children have the opportunity to receive a good education no matter what happens. Family income protection is the primary reason that most people purchase life insurance policies, but it’s not the only motivator.</p>
<h3>Applying for a Loan</h3>
<p>SBA and traditional bank loans often require a life insurance policy as collateral to protect the lender. Adequate coverage will ultimately cover any remaining debt left unpaid and will last at least for the duration of the loan. The policy holder may wish to retain coverage longer. This type of life insurance coverage is designed to cover the reimbursement of the loan to the lending entity in the event of the borrower’s death occurring  before the debt is reconciled. Any amount of coverage in excess of the debt will be paid to the borrower’s contingent beneficiary, which is typically an immediate family member or whomever the policy holder names as his or her primary beneficiary.</p>
<h3>Buying a Business</h3>
<p>Individuals who start a business or purchase a business via owner financing, a bank loan, or a combination of the two are required to have a life insurance policy that will at least cover sufficient operating costs of the business in the event that the borrower/business owner should pass away before the company has been operating long enough to pay off its debt.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Real Estate</h3>
<p>Purchasing real estate or retaining existing real estate that is considered to be a substantially valuable asset requiring a beneficiary to take ownership of and maintain following the untimely passing of the property owner is another common need for a life insurance policy. This type of insurance coverage is typically needed to make loan payments on the property or land, pay property taxes, and generally maintain the property indefinitely or until circumstances change.</p>
<h3>Refinancing Debt</h3>
<p>Often times when an individual or family refinances a substantial loan, a new life insurance policy is obtained that will cover the extended duration of the loan following the death of the primary loan holder/contributor. However, if the duration of the loan is not extended, and the purpose of the refinance is only to lock in a better interest rate, an additional life insurance policy will typically not be required by the lender.</p>
<h3>Divorce Settlement</h3>
<p>In the event of a divorce settlement, the court may order one or both parties to maintain life insurance policies consistent with the needs deemed necessary by the court.</p>
<h3>Is there a difference between a no exam term life insurance policy and a traditional term life insurance policy?</h3>
<p>The only difference is that the no exam policies have limits to the amount of coverage available (Typically $400,000). The premiums are often marginally higher due to increased risk of the insurance company not requiring a medical exam.</p>
<h3>What are the age requirements for no exam life insurance?</h3>
<p>Term life insurance is available for individuals between the ages of 18 and 75 years. </p>
<h3>How long do applications take to get approved?</h3>
<p>Application approvals will most often occur between 24-72 hours unless further review of medical information is needed. You will be notified by e-mail immediately upon your policy decision. Alternative policies requiring a medical exam can, on the other hand, take up to four weeks or more. </p>
<h3>Is there an increased price for not having to take an exam? </h3>
<p>While the insurance companies do save money underwriting policies that do not require an exam, the possibility of increased risk does exist. Therefore the cost of having a life insurance policy that does not require a medical exam is slightly higher, but the other benefits of no-exam life insurance are often worth the cost to the consumer.

<h3>Are there health requirements?</h3>
<p>Health impairments most often deter individuals from shopping for life insurance; however, many people are surprised to learn that there is in fact affordable coverage available to them. The only way to be sure that a impairment is eligible or ineligible for coverage is to complete a short risk assessment before applying for coverage. This assessment will provide you with a more accurate pricing of your policy (rather than a generic quote) before you apply, so you know what to expect. Also see our <a href="https://www.noexam.com/medical-conditions-medications/">guide to how health conditions can affect your life insurance application.</a> It will let you know what to expect when applying for life insurance with health conditions such as <a href="https://www.noexam.com/getting-life-insurance-with-diabetes-what-you-need-to-know/">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance-with-high-blood-pressure/">high blood pressure</a>, or <a href="https://www.noexam.com/life-insurance-and-anxiety/">anxiety</a>.</p>
